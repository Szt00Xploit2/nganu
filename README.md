# Flood bot TCP & UDP

Bot sends flood traffic using TCP &amp; UDP protocols to target IP Address &amp; Port

TCP and UDP flood can usually be used to attack SAMP, FiveM, Minecraft and other servers. Do not use this script for what I said above, because the purpose of making this bot is only for learning or penetration testing, not to attack targets directly.

## All Information Command

| CMD      | Information      |
|--------------|--------------|
| Registered TCP | View Address TCP |
| Registered UDP | View Address UDP |
| Start TCP | Run Traffic TCP |
| Start UDP | Run Traffic UDP |
| Add TCP Connection | `/addtcp <host> <port>` |
| Add UDP Connection | `/addudp <host> <port>` |
| Set Delay & Limit | `/setconfig <limit-traffic> <delay>` |
| /stoptcp | Stop Connection TCP |
| /stopudp | Stop Connection UDP |

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning
- For `Set Delay & Limit` I recommend using a minimum of '300' in milliseconds, because if it is 'below' then Telegram will detect many request errors in the console. 

- and the `traffic limit` is free to enter whatever you like
