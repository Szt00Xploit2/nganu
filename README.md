# Flood bot TCP & UDP

Bot sends flood traffic using TCP &amp; UDP protocols to target IP Address &amp; Port

TCP and UDP flood can usually be used to attack SAMP, FiveM, Minecraft and other servers. Do not use this script for what I said above, because the purpose of making this bot is only for learning or penetration testing, not to attack targets directly.
